# ADR 8: Observability (Proposed)

## Context

The engine must support debugging, monitoring, and performance analysis of pipelines. Observability is critical for diagnosing failures, understanding system behavior, and ensuring reliability. For the proof-of-concept, observability will be considered **proposed**, not fully implemented, but design choices should anticipate its integration.

Key requirements:

* **Logging:** Structured, per-processor logs with correlation IDs.
* **Metrics:** Latency, throughput, error counts, retries, and resource usage.
* **Tracing:** Distributed tracing across processors and backends, capturing spans and metadata.
* **Metadata propagation:** Correlation IDs, request IDs, and schema versions carried in request metadata.

Alternatives include:

* Using Rust-native crates (`tracing`, `metrics`) with exporters.
* Integrating with OpenTelemetry for multi-language, distributed observability.
* Relying on external log/metric aggregation tools.

## Decision

Observability will be treated as a **proposed capability** for the engine. The proof-of-concept will focus on execution, but the design will reserve hooks and metadata fields (`metadata` map in ProcessorRequest/Response) for future observability features.

When prioritized, the system will adopt **OpenTelemetry** as the standard for metrics, logging, and tracing, with Rustâ€™s `tracing` crate as the local implementation layer.

## Consequences

* **POC simplicity:** No immediate complexity added; logs can be basic stdout.
* **Future-ready:** Metadata propagation is already present in the Protobuf contract, enabling smooth integration later.
* **Consistency:** Using OpenTelemetry ensures interoperability across languages and backends.
* **Deferred cost:** Implementation effort is postponed, but hooks must remain consistent.
* **Tooling:** Future ADRs will cover exporters (Prometheus, Jaeger, etc.), log formatting, and sampling strategies.
