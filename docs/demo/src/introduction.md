# The DAGwood Project Demo

Welcome to an interactive demonstration of **The DAGwood Project** - a modern workflow orchestration system built in Rust that showcases cutting-edge DAG execution strategies and WASM component integration.

## Demo Goals

This 10-15 minute demonstration highlights our four primary objectives:

### ðŸ¦€ **1. Learn Rust**
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: See how Rust's memory safety enables high-performance concurrent execution
- **Async/Await**: Discover how tokio powers our non-blocking DAG processors  
- **Trait System**: Explore how traits create pluggable execution strategies
- **Error Handling**: Experience Rust's `Result<T, E>` pattern for robust workflow orchestration

### ðŸ”„ **2. Learn DAG Execution Strategies**
- **Work Queue + Dependency Counting**: Efficient topological execution with priority queues
- **Level-by-Level**: Batch processing with clear dependency boundaries
- **Reactive/Event-Driven**: Future implementation for real-time workflow orchestration
- **Hybrid Scheduling**: Advanced strategies combining multiple approaches

### ðŸ§© **3. Learn WASM Components**
- **Security Sandboxing**: True isolation using wasmtime runtime
- **Language Flexibility**: Support for Rust, C, AssemblyScript, and more
- **Performance**: Near-native execution with memory safety guarantees
- **Deterministic Execution**: Reproducible results across environments

### ðŸ¤– **4. Use Generative AI Tools**
- **Accelerated Development**: How AI assistance enabled rapid prototyping
- **Learning Enhancement**: AI-guided exploration of complex Rust concepts
- **Code Quality**: AI-assisted refactoring and optimization
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs generated with AI collaboration
