#### Key Concepts for DAGwood

##### Ownership and Borrowing
```rust
// Essential for understanding DAGwood's memory management
fn ownership_examples() {
    // Owned values
    let processor_id = String::from("my_processor");
    
    // Borrowed references
    let id_ref = &processor_id;
    
    // Cloning for ownership transfer
    let id_clone = processor_id.clone();
    
    // Arc for shared ownership
    let shared_id = Arc::new(processor_id);
}
```

##### Async/Await Programming
```rust
// Critical for understanding DAG execution
#[tokio::main]
async fn async_examples() {
    // Spawning concurrent tasks
    let handle = tokio::spawn(async {
        // Async work
    });
    
    // Waiting for completion
    let result = handle.await?;
    
    // Parallel execution
    let (result1, result2) = tokio::join!(
        async_task_1(),
        async_task_2()
    );
}
```

##### Error Handling
```rust
// Essential for robust DAG execution
fn error_handling_examples() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Using ? operator for propagation
    let config = load_config("config.yaml")?;
    
    // Custom error types
    match execute_processor(&config) {
        Ok(result) => println!("Success: {:?}", result),
        Err(ProcessorError::ValidationError { message }) => {
            eprintln!("Validation failed: {}", message);
        },
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Other error: {}", e),
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```
