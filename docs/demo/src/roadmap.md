```

## Phase 5: Reactive Execution (Next Priority)

### Reactive Executor Implementation

The next major milestone is implementing the Reactive/Event-Driven executor:

```rust
// Planned Reactive executor architecture
pub struct ReactiveExecutor {
    event_bus: Arc<EventBus>,
    processor_nodes: HashMap<String, ProcessorNode>,
    canonical_payload: Arc<Mutex<Vec<u8>>>,
}

struct ProcessorNode {
    processor: Box<dyn Processor>,
    state: ProcessorState,
    dependencies: HashSet<String>,
    dependents: HashSet<String>,
    pending_dependencies: HashSet<String>,
}

enum ProcessorState {
    Waiting,
    Ready,
    Executing,
    Completed { result: ProcessorResponse },
    Failed { error: ProcessorError },
}
```

#### Key Features to Implement

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   ```rust
   enum ProcessorEvent {
       Ready { processor_id: String },
       Started { processor_id: String, timestamp: Instant },
       Completed { processor_id: String, result: ProcessorResponse },
       Failed { processor_id: String, error: ProcessorError },
   }
   ```

2. **Real-Time Responsiveness**
   - Immediate reaction to processor completion
   - Dynamic dependency resolution
   - Event sourcing for complete audit trails

3. **Backpressure Handling**
   - Automatic flow control under load
   - Resource-aware scheduling
   - Graceful degradation patterns

### Implementation Timeline

```rust
struct ReactiveImplementationPlan {
    phase_1: "Event bus and processor node architecture (2 weeks)",
    phase_2: "Basic event-driven execution (2 weeks)", 
    phase_3: "Integration with existing infrastructure (1 week)",
    phase_4: "Performance optimization and testing (1 week)",
    total_estimate: "6 weeks",
}
```

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

Combine multiple execution strategies for optimal performance:

```rust
pub struct HybridExecutor {
    strategies: HashMap<String, Box<dyn DagExecutor>>,
    analyzer: DagAnalyzer,
}

impl HybridExecutor {
    async fn execute(&self, dag: &DependencyGraph) -> Result<ExecutionResults, ExecutionError> {
        // Analyze DAG characteristics
        let analysis = self.analyzer.analyze(dag);
        
        // Choose optimal strategy or partition DAG
        match analysis.recommendation {
            StrategyRecommendation::Single(strategy) => {
                self.strategies[&strategy].execute(dag).await
            },
            StrategyRecommendation::Partition { regions } => {
                self.execute_partitioned(regions).await
            },
        }
    }
}
```
