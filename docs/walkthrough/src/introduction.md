# The DAGwood Project Demo

Welcome to an interactive demonstration of **The DAGwood Project** - a modern pipeline orchestration system built in Rust that showcases cutting-edge DAG execution strategies and WASM component integration.

## Project Goals

### ðŸ¦€ **1. Learn Rust**
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: See how Rust's memory safety enables high-performance concurrent execution
- **Async/Await**: Discover how tokio powers non-blocking DAG processors  
- **Trait System**: Explore how traits create pluggable execution strategies
- **Error Handling**: Experience Rust's `Result<T, E>` pattern for robust pipeline orchestration

### ðŸ”„ **2. Learn DAG Execution Strategies**
- **Work Queue + Dependency Counting**: Efficient topological execution with priority queues
- **Level-by-Level**: Batch processing with clear dependency boundaries
- **Reactive/Event-Driven**: Future implementation for real-time pipeline orchestration
- **Hybrid Scheduling**: Advanced strategies combining multiple approaches

### ðŸ§© **3. Learn WASM Components**
- **Security Sandboxing**: True isolation using wasmtime runtime
- **Language Flexibility**: Support for Rust, C, AssemblyScript, and more
- **Performance**: Near-native execution with memory safety guarantees
- **Deterministic Execution**: Reproducible results across environments

### ðŸ¤– **4. Use Generative AI Tools**
- **Accelerated Development**: How AI assistance enabled rapid prototyping
- **Learning Enhancement**: AI-guided exploration of complex Rust concepts
- **Code Quality**: AI-assisted refactoring and optimization
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs generated with AI collaboration
- **RUSTME** files, For each subsystem in the project I had the AI generate a RUSTME file. These files highlight the key Rust concepts and patterns used in the code.
- **LLMs Used**: For primary coding I used WindSurf with the Claude Sonnet 4 model. Additionally, Copilot performed PR reviews. For the Executors particularly, I used Grok to review the code.

## What You'll See

### System Architecture Overview
Before diving into the demos, the **Architecture Overview** provides essential context:
- **High-level system design** with component relationships
- **Design patterns** used throughout (Factory, Strategy, Trait System)
- **Execution strategies** comparison (Work Queue, Level-by-Level, Reactive)
- **Memory management** and performance optimizations
- **Extensibility architecture** for custom processors and backends

### Progressive Complexity Journey
1. **Hello World** â†’ Single processor basics
2. **Text Pipeline** â†’ Linear data flow and chaining  
3. **Diamond Analysis** â†’ Parallel execution and metadata collection
4. **WASM Integration** â†’ Sandboxed processing with multiple languages
5. **Complex Pipeline** â†’ Real-world multi-backend orchestration

### Live Demonstrations
- **Interactive Execution**: Real DAG processing with live output
- **Configuration Examples**: YAML-driven pipeline definitions
- **Performance Comparison**: Different execution strategies in action
