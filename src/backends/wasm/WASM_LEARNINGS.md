# WASM Implementation Learnings

This document captures the key learnings and challenges encountered while implementing the WASM backend for The DAGwood project, particularly the debugging process that led to a fully functional WASM processor.

## Initial Problem: SIMD Configuration Conflicts

### Issue
The original implementation suffered from SIMD-related warnings and configuration conflicts in wasmtime:
```
cannot disable the simd proposal but enable the relaxed simd proposal
```

### Root Cause
Conflicting SIMD feature configuration in wasmtime where relaxed SIMD was implicitly enabled while regular SIMD was disabled.

### Solution
Explicitly disabled both SIMD proposals to avoid conflicts:
```rust
config.wasm_simd(false);
config.wasm_relaxed_simd(false);  // Explicitly disable relaxed SIMD to avoid conflicts
```

**Result**: ✅ Eliminated SIMD warnings and configuration conflicts

## Major Problem: WASM Execution Failures

### Issue
After resolving SIMD issues, WASM modules compiled successfully but failed during execution with:
```
wasm trap: interrupt
error while executing at wasm backtrace:
    0:  0x722 - hello_world_wasm.wasm!allocate
```

### Debugging Process

#### Step 1: Isolate the Problem
Used wasmtime CLI to test WASM modules directly:
```bash
wasmtime --invoke allocate hello_world.wasm 51
# Result: 1114120 (success)
```

**Key Insight**: WASM modules worked perfectly with CLI wasmtime but failed in DAGwood, indicating the issue was in the DAGwood wasmtime configuration, not the WASM module itself.

#### Step 2: Test Different Allocation Strategies
Tried multiple memory allocation approaches to rule out allocator issues:

1. **Standard Vec Allocation**:
   ```rust
   let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(size);
   vec.resize(size, 0);
   let ptr = vec.as_mut_ptr();
   std::mem::forget(vec);
   ```

2. **Box-based Allocation**:
   ```rust
   let layout = vec![0u8; size];
   let boxed = layout.into_boxed_slice();
   Box::into_raw(boxed) as *mut u8
   ```

3. **Static Buffer Allocation**:
   ```rust
   static mut STATIC_BUFFER: [u8; 4096] = [0; 4096];
   // Simple bump allocator implementation
   ```
   - Implements a simple bump allocator: memory is allocated by incrementing an offset within the static buffer
   - Each allocation returns a pointer to the next free region; deallocation is not supported
   - This approach is fast but limited to the fixed buffer size and is suitable for demonstration or testing purposes 

4. **std::alloc Direct Usage**:
   ```rust
   let layout = Layout::from_size_align_unchecked(size, 1);
   alloc(layout)
   ```

**Result**: All allocation strategies failed with the same "wasm trap: interrupt" error in DAGwood but worked perfectly with CLI wasmtime.

#### Step 3: Address Potential dlmalloc Issues
Based on research into Rust 1.78+ WASM compilation issues (rustwasm/wasm-pack#1389), implemented `wee_alloc` as a safer WASM allocator:

```rust
use wee_alloc::WeeAlloc;

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: WeeAlloc = WeeAlloc::INIT;
```

**Result**: Still failed with the same error, confirming the issue was not allocator-related.

#### Step 4: Investigate Wasmtime Version Differences
Discovered a critical version mismatch:
- **CLI wasmtime**: Version 9.0.4
- **DAGwood wasmtime**: Version 25.0

**Key Insight**: Major version differences in wasmtime can introduce breaking changes in default configurations.

### Root Cause Discovery
The issue was **wasmtime 25.0's epoch interruption feature** that was enabled by default and causing false "interrupt" traps during normal WASM execution.

### Final Solution
Added explicit configuration to disable epoch interruption:
```rust
// Disable epoch interruption which might cause "interrupt" traps
config.epoch_interruption(false);
```

**Result**: ✅ WASM execution now works perfectly

## Key Technical Learnings

### 1. Wasmtime Version Compatibility
- **Major version differences** can introduce breaking changes in default configurations
- **CLI wasmtime vs embedded wasmtime** may have different default settings
- Always check version compatibility when debugging WASM execution issues

### 2. WASM Memory Management
- **Multiple allocation strategies** can work in WASM (Vec, Box, static buffers, wee_alloc)
- **wee_alloc is recommended** for WASM as it's specifically designed for WebAssembly environments
- **Memory allocation issues** are often configuration-related rather than code-related

### 3. Debugging WASM Issues
- **Test with CLI wasmtime first** to isolate whether issues are in the WASM module or the host configuration
- **Use detailed error reporting** with wasmtime's error types to get specific failure information
- **Systematic elimination** of potential causes (allocators, fuel, memory limits, etc.)

### 4. Wasmtime Configuration Best Practices
Essential configuration for wasmtime 25.0+ in embedded scenarios:
```rust
// Enable fuel consumption for security (prevents infinite loops/resource exhaustion)
config.consume_fuel(true);

// Disable features that can cause unexpected interrupts
config.epoch_interruption(false);

// Disable unnecessary features for security and compatibility
config.wasm_threads(false);
config.wasm_simd(false);
config.wasm_relaxed_simd(false);
config.wasm_multi_memory(false);
config.wasm_memory64(false);
config.wasm_component_model(false);
```

## Performance Results

After resolving all issues:
- **Execution Time**: ~60-70ms for WASM processing
- **Memory Efficiency**: wee_alloc provides optimal memory usage
- **Security**: Full sandboxing with wasmtime isolation
- **Reliability**: Deterministic execution with proper configuration

## WASM Module Interface

Successfully implemented a clean C-style interface for WASM modules:
```rust
extern "C" fn process(input_ptr: *const u8, input_len: usize, output_len: *mut usize) -> *mut u8;
extern "C" fn allocate(size: usize) -> *mut u8;
extern "C" fn deallocate(ptr: *mut u8, size: usize);
```

## Integration Success

The WASM backend now successfully integrates with:
- ✅ **All DAG execution strategies** (WorkQueue, Level-by-Level, Reactive)
- ✅ **Metadata collection** with rich execution metrics
- ✅ **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ **Configuration system** with YAML-driven module specification

## Recommendations for Future WASM Development

1. **Always test with CLI wasmtime first** when debugging execution issues
2. **Use wee_alloc** as the global allocator for WASM modules
3. **Explicitly configure wasmtime** rather than relying on defaults
4. **Check wasmtime version compatibility** between CLI and embedded usage
5. **Implement systematic debugging** by isolating WASM module vs host configuration issues
6. **Monitor wasmtime release notes** for breaking changes in default configurations
