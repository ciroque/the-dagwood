# WASI Import Limitation

## Issue
The Grain RLE WASM component cannot currently run in DAGwood's sandboxed WASM environment due to WASI imports.

## Root Cause
- **Grain Standard Library**: Grain's standard library modules (String, List, Char, etc.) include WASI imports
- **DAGwood Security Model**: DAGwood's WASM backend prohibits ALL WASI imports for complete sandboxing
- **Architectural Conflict**: Grain is designed to work with WASI, DAGwood requires WASI-free modules

## Error Message
```
Warning: Failed to create WASM processor 'grain_rle_processor': Invalid input: WASI imports are not allowed: wasi_snapshot_preview1. Using stub instead.
```

## Current Status
- ✅ **Grain Code**: Compiles successfully and demonstrates functional programming concepts
- ✅ **WASM Generation**: Produces valid WASM modules (153KB)
- ❌ **DAGwood Integration**: Blocked by WASI import restriction

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Custom Grain Standard Library
- Create WASI-free versions of String, List, Char modules
- Significant effort, would need to reimplement core functionality
- May not be feasible due to Grain's architecture

### 2. DAGwood WASM Backend Enhancement
- Add limited WASI support with sandboxing
- Allow specific WASI functions (memory management, basic I/O)
- Requires careful security analysis

### 3. Alternative Language
- Use Rust, C, or AssemblyScript for WASM components
- These can compile to pure WASM without WASI dependencies
- Less functional programming showcase

### 4. Grain Compiler Flags
- Investigate if Grain has options to compile without WASI
- May require newer Grain versions or experimental features

## Recommendation
For immediate DAGwood integration, consider using Rust or C for WASM components. The Grain implementation serves as an excellent demonstration of functional programming concepts and can be used as a reference for future WASI-compatible WASM backends.

## Value Delivered
Despite the integration limitation, this implementation successfully demonstrates:
- ✅ Functional programming patterns in Grain
- ✅ Run-length encoding algorithm with pattern matching
- ✅ WASM compilation and build processes
- ✅ Component architecture and documentation
- ✅ Integration configuration examples
